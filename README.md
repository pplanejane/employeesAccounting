# This is Employees Accounting Webapp (CRUD React.js App)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It implements the basic features of React.js, create, read, update, delete (CRUD). In this web application, you can add new employees, edit their salaries, when you click on each employee, you will mark that they will be promoted, when you click on the button to the right, you will add a parameter that this employee will receive a bonus, when you click on the trash can, you can delete an employee. Also in the top there is a header where the number of employees and the number of those who will receive a bonus are displayed in real time. Above the employees, a filter is implemented on their list, according to different options, that is, employees with a salary of more than 1000 or employees who are being promoted. Both of these options also have a filter by name when entered in the search field. At the bottom, you can add employees, you cannot add an employee with a name less than 3 characters or a salary of 0.<b> In this project I learned and use a lot of React.js basic features, like Classes, Components, States, this, Inline Styles, JSX, React-fragments, Class fields, static</b> etc.
